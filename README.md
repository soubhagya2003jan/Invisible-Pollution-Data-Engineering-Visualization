## ⚙️ Methodology

- 📥 **Data Retrieval:** Fetched from the OpenAQ AWS S3 bucket using a custom Python script with the **Boto3 SDK**.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Sensor errors (extreme values) removed using **Pandas**, and the dataset is transformed for usability.
- 📊 **EDA:** Performed for quick insights into pollutants across time and locations.
- 📈 **Tableau:** Used to dive deep into data patterns and spatial pollution mapping.
- 🎨 **Figma:** Used to prototype dashboard layout—scatter plots, maps, and correlation visuals were planned beforehand.
- 📚 **Research:** Conducted on Indian air quality issues to ensure insights are grounded in reality.

## 🔍 Findings

- 🏙️ **Delhi** records the highest levels of **PM2.5** and **PM10** pollution.
- 📈 Multiple cities operate **above WHO safety limits**, posing risks even to healthy individuals.
- 🔗 A strong **correlation between PM2.5 and PM10** values is observed across states.
- 🏗️ **Construction dust** and **residential fuel usage** are major contributing factors.
